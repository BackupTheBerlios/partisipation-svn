    SCRIPT: Document type definitions for the scenarios. 
    
    AUTHORS: Anton Huttenlocher, Oleksiy Reznikov

    NOTE: Please pay attention to the number, type, and order
          of parameters for each method call in your
          scenario files. They must conform to the
          GUI interface specification. This is NOT
          ensured by this DTD (i.e. a scenario that
          is completely valid against this DTD will
          fail at execution if you'll use a string value 
          where an integer does belong to according to
          the interface specification).
