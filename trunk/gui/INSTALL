Dependencies:
-------------

At the moment the GUI comes with all necessary libraries in gui/lib. These
are the following:

- Apache XML-RPC 2.0
  http://ws.apache.org/xmlrpc/
  
- Xerces-J 2.7.0
  http://xml.apache.org/xerces2-j/

- AbsoluteLayout.jar from NetBeans
  http://www.netbeans.org/

- Commons Codec 1.3
  http://jakarta.apache.org/commons/codec/

- SAX 2.0.2
  http://www.saxproject.org/

As long as these jar files are in your ./lib directory, everything is fine. 
Otherwise you'll have to fetch them from the mentioned sites.


Installation:
-------------

- untar or unzip
- create the folder ".partiSIPation/" in your $HOME directory:

  $> mkdir ~/.partiSIPation
  
- copy the configuration files in this directory

  $> cp cfg/gui_config.* ~/.partiSIPation/
  
- edit the configuration files and replace and change the IPs in <core> and 
  <gui>
  
  
Execution:
----------

After installation, the GUI can be started with:

   $> java -jar partiSIPation-GUI.jar

If you are using the SVN checkout, the GUI will be started from the directory
of your checkout using Apache Ant:

   $> ant run
   
Or you could create the jar file with

   $> ant jar
   
and run it as decribed above.

If you don't have Apache Ant, include all jar files in ./lib in your classpath
and run it using the main class "gui.Gui".
