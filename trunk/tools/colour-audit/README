    Audit::Source - an interface to source code vulnerability scanners
============================================================================

Synopsis

    use Audit::Source;
    $audit = new Audit::Source;
    $audit->run_all($file);
    $audit->textdump();

Description

    Audit::Source is a group of modules to make processing of source code
    vulnerability scanners easier. Each scanner is implemented by a separate
    module (see MODULES) which parses the results and stores them into a
    common data format. Results from different scanners can be matched
    against each other.

Modules

    Audit::Source::Rats
    Audit::Source::Flawfinder
    Audit::Source::Pscan
    Audit::Source::Splint
